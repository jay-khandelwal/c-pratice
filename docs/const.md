`const` is used to declare a variable as a constant, which means that its value cannot be modified once it is initialized.

The "const" keyword can be used with any data type, including integers, floats, arrays, and structures.

Using "const" can help make the code more robust and less error-prone, as it prevents accidental modification of values that should not be changed. 

It can also help the compiler optimize the code, as it knows that the value of a constant will not change during execution. For example, if the compiler knows that a variable is a constant, it can replace all occurrences of that variable with its actual value, rather than accessing the variable each time it is used. This can reduce the number of memory accesses and improve performance.
