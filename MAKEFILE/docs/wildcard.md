example :

````
SRCDIR = src
SOURCES = $(wildcard $(SRCDIR)/*.c)
```

In this example, the wildcard function is used to find all source files with the .c extension in the src directory. The resulting list of file names is stored in the SOURCES variable.

The wildcard function returns a list of file names that match the pattern, separated by spaces. If no files match the pattern, the function returns an empty string.

The pattern can include wildcard characters such as * and ?, which match any sequence of characters and any single character, respectively.
