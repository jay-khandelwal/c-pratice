#pragma is a preprocessor directive in C and C++ that is used to provide instructions to the compiler or linker.

The syntax of a #pragma directive is as follows:

```
#pragma <instruction>
```

The instruction provided after the #pragma keyword is implementation-defined and can vary depending on the compiler being used. Some common uses of #pragma directives include:

Controlling compiler-specific options, such as optimization level or warnings
Including additional files or libraries during compilation
Specifying alignment or packing options for structures
Suppressing or enabling specific warnings or error messages
Controlling the order of functions or data in memory
Specifying the entry point for a program
