#define is a preprocessor directive in C and C++ that is used to define constants or macros in the code. It is typically used to define values that are used throughout the program and are not expected to change during runtime.

syntax :-
#define constant value

example :-

After this line is processed by the preprocessor, any occurrence of PI in the code will be replaced with the value 3.14159. For example:
```
#define PI 3.14159

float radius = 5.0;
float circumference = 2 * PI * radius;
```
will be transformed into:

```
float radius = 5.0;
float circumference = 2 * 3.14159 * radius;
```







In addition to defining constants, #define can also be used to define macros, which are code snippets that can be expanded inline by the preprocessor

syntax :-
#define macro_name(parameters) replacement_code

```
#define MIN(x, y) ((x) < (y) ? (x) : (y))

int a = 5, b = 10;
int min_value = MIN(a, b);
```

will be transformed into:

```
int a = 5, b = 10;
int min_value = ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b));
```



Question 1: Can we use global variable instead of using #define for defining variable

Answer : No, using global variables instead of #define for defining constants is not a good practice.

The main purpose of #define is to define constants, which are values that do not change during the execution of a program. These constants are substituted by the preprocessor at compile-time, which can improve performance and make the code easier to read and maintain.

On the other hand, global variables are values that can be modified at runtime, and their use should be limited to cases where they are necessary. If a value is intended to be a constant, it should be declared as such using #define or a const variable, to make it clear that its value should not change during the program's execution.

In addition, using global variables instead of #define for constants can lead to issues with naming conflicts and memory usage, as global variables take up space in memory even if they are not used.

Overall, it is a best practice to use #define or const variables for defining constants, and to limit the use of global variables to cases where they are necessary.



Question 2: instead of using #define for defining variable can we use global const variable

Answer: Yes, it is generally considered a better practice to use a global const variable instead of #define for defining constants.

A const variable is similar to a #define constant in that it cannot be modified at runtime, but it is a typed variable that takes up space in memory. Using a global const variable instead of #define can help to avoid issues with type mismatches and can make the code easier to read and maintain.

Overall, using global const variables instead of #define for defining constants is considered a best practice in modern C programming.
